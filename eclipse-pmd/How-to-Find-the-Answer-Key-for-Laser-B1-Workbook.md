Some users have uploaded the answer key for Laser B1 workbook as a PDF file on Scribd. You can download this file for free if you have a Scribd account or if you upload a document of your own.

You can type in keywords like "answer key for laser b1 workbook" or "laser b1 workbook with key pdf" and see what results come up.

As you can see, finding the answer key for Laser B1 workbook is not very easy or straightforward. You might have to spend some money, time, or effort to get it. However, you should not rely on the answer key too much, as it is more important to understand the concepts and practice the skills than to get the correct answers. You can also use other sources of feedback and guidance, such as teachers, tutors, classmates, friends, or online forums. Remember that learning English is a journey that requires patience, persistence, and curiosity.
  
Another option for finding the answer key for Laser B1 workbook is to read some reviews from other users who have used the workbook.

Workbook with key + Audio-CD[^3^]. You can browse through these editions and see what other users have said about them.
 
However, you might notice that there are not many reviews for Laser B1 workbook on Goodreads.

Therefore, you might not find much useful information or advice from reading reviews on Goodreads. You might have to look for other sources of reviews, such as online forums, blogs, or social media platforms.
 
In conclusion, finding the answer key for Laser B1 workbook is not a simple task. You might have to try different methods and sources to get it. However, you should not let this discourage you from using the workbook as a tool for learning English. The workbook is a valuable resource that can help you improve your language skills and prepare for exams. You should focus on understanding the concepts and practicing the skills rather than getting the correct answers. You should also seek feedback and guidance from other sources, such as teachers, tutors, classmates, friends, or online communities. Remember that learning English is a fun and rewarding process that requires curiosity and creativity.
